                <h4>what I have done</h4>
                <p class="code-skill">In 2011, I became part of the hip hop group named “Cutie Pie”, 
                    and I auditioned in ‘Korea’s Got Talent, The group reached the semi-finals. 
                    Momoland performed in numerous television shows in my teens, such as ‘The Unlimited.’ 
                    In the year 2012, I also performed in Mar Ee Rae Show: Just Do It Expedition where Nancy had visited the Philippines and Saipan,
                    with the South Korean actress named Kim Yoo-Jung. Nancy became a contestant on Mnet’s reality survival shows Finding Momoland in the year 2016, 
                    I completed the competition in 2nd place,
                    thus becoming a member of the girl’s group Momoland.</p>

                <h4>My activities</h4>
                <p class="code-skill">I always knew the titular role wasn’t mine. 
                    By the way, I was the first one to be cast as Kashi. 
                    Sanjay sir told me I need to know who my Kashi is for me to understand who can be my Bajirao and Mastani. 
                    Stanislavski said, ‘There are no small roles, there are only small actors’ and I’ve lived by it. 
                    I’m not a small actor either. Nor am I a small person. I’ve done eight scenes in Bajirao Mastani,
                    but what a role! It broke my heart when the film was narrated to me. Prakash bhai (Kapadia) said, ‘Itihaas Kashi ko bhool gaya hai. 
                    She raised Bajirao and Mastani’s son, Shamsher to be one of the biggest Maratha warriors’. I do enough films with
                    For what? If my husband fell in love with another woman, I’d say bye bye. Kashi possessed self-respect. 
                    In the 1700s, where you couldn’t have divorced, she tells her husband, ‘Go! And don’t come back to my room’. 
                    It’s such a progressive thought. She says, ‘You could have asked for anything and I’d have given. 
                    But you took away my pride. Go, be with her I’ve no problem. But can you live with that lie?’ I found her part so relevant in today’s times as well. 
                    I didn’t want Kashi’s story to go wrong. Because a woman’s pride is her greatest jewel. 
                    You can’t let anyone take that away.</p>
